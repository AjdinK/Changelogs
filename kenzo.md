# AospExtended 4.2 for Kenzo New OTA! 

**[13.05.17]**
- Fixed FLAC 24-Bit files not playing
- Silent tile is back
- Revert screen pinning improvements
- Changed configs to 300Hz for smoother UX


**Next Update :**

- Update power configurations
- Fix BoardThermTemp sensor
- Upstream from AospExtended
- Maybe Add UBIFocus, Chromaflash, Optizoom etc (If Fixed)


**Note:** _Can be dirty flashed. However, I tried porting UBIFOCUS etc. Features were crashing after pictures were taken. H2 have those because it has new BSP. My git has got all the commits for it though. If someone fixes them, I'll re-add them_.
